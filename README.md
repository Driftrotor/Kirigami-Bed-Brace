# Kirigami Bed Brace
 Want to make you Kirigmai a little stiffer?

This was born out of simply wanting to make my Kirigami Bed stiffer as when doing fast Y travels i noticed the bed would "Bounce" and also to help when Leveling the Bed.

After the initial release on my Printables and sharing it with the Voron Community I had lots of Great Feedback.
After some tweaking to further refine the design it turned into a sleak and easy to install afair.

Further on the Voron Community put in many many requests to push the design for more options so others with different setups could also enjoy the benifits of the Kirigami Bed Brace.
and now Nearly ALL of them having a FAN option too!

If you need a different configuration of the Bed Brace, get in touch and i can wip one up for you.
